Best to ignore these scripts. I am keeping these for completeness sake and they should not be used.

Contains various figures used for this study. Most figures are self-explanatory and the useful ones are all in the text.

data/

Throughout 'conservative' refers to data that was cleaned to omit plants for which treatment failed.
'ml' - refers to max. likelihood, which I use as shorthand to refer to point estimates of posterior prob. distributions.
